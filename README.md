# Facial-Recognition-on-Dimensionally-Reduced-Datasets
Our goal is to perform facial recognition on a dimensionally-reduced dataset using principal component  analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) di- mensionality reduction methods. This report illustrates the  performance of a simple classifier given a dataset preprocessed by the aforementioned methods.
